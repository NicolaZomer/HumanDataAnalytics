# Human Data Analytics
This repository is realized following the path of the course [Human Data Analytics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2022/LM/IN/IN2371/004PD/INP9087860/N0), which covers advanced and applied machine learning techniques, applied to real world problem within the human data domain. 

## Topics
### 1) Dimensionality reduction and clustering
_Tools:_
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA
- Unsupervised Clustering: K-means, SOM, GNG, DB-SCAN

_Applications:_ Electrocardiography (ECG) signal
  
### 2) Neural Networks
_Tools:_
- Feed Forward (FFNN), Convolutional (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Residual Networks
- Implementation tricks: batch normalization, dropout, inception layers, attention mechanism, autoencoders
- Times series analysis: RNN, RNN+attention, transformer model

_Applications:_
- ECG signal
- Pulse oximeter (blood oxygenation)
- Speech analysis
- Inertial signal (motion analysis)
- Authentication, activity recognition (heterogeneous data)
- Medical images: lymphoma classification
